If you have any issues or suggestions, ping me on Discord (SSM24#0079) or open an issue. Pinging me on Discord is preferred, since I check that much more often than Github.

## Known Issues
* The "Should Apply to Multishops" option currently only works for the host, since the method hooked is serverside. If someone knows a clientside equivalent I can use, let me know!
