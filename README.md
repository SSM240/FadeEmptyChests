# FadeEmptyChests
A mod for Risk of Rain 2 that makes chests and other containers fade out and become partially transparent after being opened.

More information can be found on [the Thunderstore page](https://thunderstore.io/package/SSM24/FadeEmptyChests/).

If you have any issues or suggestions, ping me on Discord (SSM24#0079) or open an issue. Pinging me on Discord is preferred, since I check that much more often than GitHub.

## Known Issues
* The "Should Apply to Multishops" and "Should Apply to Adaptive Chests" options currently only work for the host, since the methods hooked are serverside. If you are not the host in multiplayer, multishops will simply not fade out for you, regardless of the setting. If someone knows a clientside equivalent I can use, let me know!
